# Clean & Analyze Social Media Data
This project shows how to generate, clean, analyze, and visualize social media engagement data using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, and random.

## Features
- Generate a dataset of 500 posts with random categories and likes.
- Clean data by removing missing values and duplicates.
- Analyze with summary statistics and category counts.
- Visualize data:
  - Histogram of likes distribution.
  - Boxplot of likes per category.
- Calculate:
  - Mean likes overall.
  - Mean likes per category.

## Technologies Used
- pandas – data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib – plotting and labeling graphs
- seaborn – statistical visualizations (distribution plots, boxplots)
- numpy – numerical operations, random likes generation
- random – random assignment of categories
